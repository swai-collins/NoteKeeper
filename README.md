# NoteKeeper

During ALC 5.0, I was able to build the app with the help of Jim Wilson on PluralSight Associate Android Developer Path course. The app is a note-keeping app that can store the progress of each course taking. The app can show alarm message or notification to remind someone those course at a particular time. It has nice UI/UX.
